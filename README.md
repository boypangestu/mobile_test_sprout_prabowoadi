# Mobile Developer Test - Sprout Digital Labs

## Introduction
This is my submission for the Mobile Developer Test at Sprout Digital Labs. The test was completed by Prabowo Adi Pangestu.

## Features
- Fetches Pokémon data from the PokeAPI.
- Displays a list of Pokémon names, images, and colors based on their types.
